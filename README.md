# 42_LYON PROJECTS
My 101 repository for school projects

### - 00_PISCINE
This folder contains all the code from 42 selection month.<br>
During four weeks we were given exercices everyday, most of them about C programming.

### - 01_LIBFT and 01_LIBFT_BIS
First project from 42.<br>
This is a small C library. The school forces us to code our own replica from standard library.<br>
The 05_FTPRINTF project has benn added to the original libft.<br>
The 01_LIBFT_BIS is an alternative which is not adapted to 42 norme.

### - 02_GNL
This is a C programming project.<br>
We had to code a function which was supposed to read lines from a file descriptor.<br>
Memory leaks were forbidden.

### - 03_FILLIT
This is also a C programming project.<br>
This one focuses on creating a bruteforce algorithm in order to find the best way to fill a grid with tetriminos (pieces from tetris game).<br>

### - 04_FDF
This is a C graphical project.<br>
We were supposed to learn to use the 42 GUI Library in order to generate wireframe objects.<br>
My project is not really good. I made it using my own interpretation of 3D geometric programming.<br>
Actually, it enabled me to understand that there were really good methods for 3D :)

### - 05_FT_PRINTF
This is a C project.<br>
The target was to code the printf function from scratch. This is a good exercice which teaches about parsing, function pointers and code organization.

### - 06_FRACTOL
This is a C graphical project.<br>
We had to make a program which displays fractals. We implemented infinite zoom, multithreding, several fractals, a basic GUI and several color schemes.<br>
It uses the 42 GUI Library.

### - 07_INIT
An introduction to Linux shell scripting and virtualization.

### - 08_PUSHSWAP
Algorithm project: experiment several sorting algorithm.<br>
Did not work on that project.

### - 09_PISCINE_PHP
Two weeks introcuction to PHP, OOP and web programming.<br>
It is an intensive intro during which we are given exercices everyday.

### - 10_CAMAGRU
First 42 web project.<br>
It's a web app which enables the users to suscribe, take picture from their webcams, comment other users' pics, etc.<br>
The backend is a PHP application, implemented using MVC pattern.<br>
The front-end part contains some JS but a very dirty JS code :) Actually, I did not know about it and took some code online without learning JS deeply. Of course, later, I spent a lot of time to revisit that stupid mistake.

### - 11_MATCHA
Second web project from 42.<br>
This is not the final version but I think I have lost it (maybe my former team mate stil has it).<br>
We were supposed to make a dating site.<br>
I worked on the backend using NodeJS, Express in order to make a REST API. We also built a Mysql database, using Merise method.<br>
My team mate built all the front end using React, but this part of the code is not here.

### - VIM
My own VIM config
